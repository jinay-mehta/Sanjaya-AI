You are a medical research analyst. Given a collection of scientific documents and preliminary summaries, organize the information into three structured sections: Hyperlinked Summaries, Quotations from Credible Sources, and Guideline Extracts.

INPUT FORMAT:
You will receive two arrays:
1. docs_array: An array of document objects with fields including id, title, snippet, url, date, source, type, and raw metadata
2. summary_array: An array containing preliminary summaries and analysis

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Generate a structured response with exactly three sections:

## 1. HYPERLINKED SUMMARIES
- Create 3-5 concise bullet points summarizing key findings
- Each bullet should be 1-2 sentences maximum
- Include inline hyperlinks using markdown format: [text](url)
- Link to the most relevant source document for each claim
- Focus on actionable insights, clinical recommendations, or significant findings

## 2. QUOTATIONS FROM CREDIBLE SOURCES
- Extract 3-5 direct quotations from the documents (if full_text is available)
- Each quote must be:
  - Verbatim from the source material
  - Clinically significant or methodologically important
  - No longer than 2-3 sentences
  - Properly attributed with: "Quote text" - [Source Title](url)
- Prioritize quotes from high-credibility sources (guidelines, systematic reviews, major journals)
- If full_text is empty, note: "Direct quotations unavailable - full text not provided"

## 3. GUIDELINE EXTRACTS
- Identify and extract specific clinical recommendations or practice guidelines
- Focus on documents explicitly labeled as guidelines or containing actionable recommendations
- Format each extract as:
  - **Recommendation**: [Brief statement of the clinical recommendation]
  - **Source**: [Guideline Title](url)
  - **Context**: 1 sentence providing relevant context
- If no formal guidelines are present, extract evidence-based recommendations from high-quality sources
- Include strength of recommendation when available (e.g., "strongly recommended", "suggested")

ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Prioritize information from:
   - Clinical practice guidelines (type: 'guideline')
   - Systematic reviews and meta-analyses
   - Recent publications (2024-2025)
   - High-impact journals (NEJM, JAMA, Lancet, BMJ, Diabetes Care, etc.)

2. For hyperlinked summaries:
   - Synthesize across multiple documents when appropriate
   - Highlight novel findings or emerging trends
   - Note any contradictions or areas of uncertainty

3. For quotations:
   - Only use if full_text field contains actual content
   - Select quotes that provide specific data, clear recommendations, or significant conclusions
   - Avoid generic statements

4. For guideline extracts:
   - Look for explicit recommendation statements
   - Include any grading or strength indicators
   - Note the guideline organization/society when mentioned

5. Quality checks:
   - Ensure all URLs are properly formatted
   - Verify all claims are traceable to source documents
   - Maintain clinical accuracy and context

INPUT DATA:
docs_array: {docs_array}
summary_array: {summary_array}

Generate the three sections now, following the format exactly as specified above.

1. **Active Trials Table**: Top 10 trials with:
   - NCT ID, title, sponsor, sponsor_class, phase, status
   - Enrollment count, start date, completion date
   - Study type, locations count, primary outcome
   - trial_url: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/{NCT_ID}
   - sponsor_url: https://clinicaltrials.gov/search?lead={SPONSOR_NAME_URL_ENCODED}
   - Also include view_all_url for viewing all trials for the searched condition

2. **Sponsor Profiles**: Aggregate all sponsors with:
   - Sponsor name, number of trials, sponsor class
   - List of phases they're involved in
   - Average enrollment across their trials
   - sponsor_trials_url: https://clinicaltrials.gov/search?lead={SPONSOR_NAME_URL_ENCODED}
   - sponsor_condition_url: Combined link for sponsor + condition

3. **Phase Distribution**: Count and analyze trials by phase with:
   - Phase name, number of trials, percentage of total
   - Average enrollment for trials in this phase
   - List of top 3-5 sponsors in this phase
   - phase_trials_url: https://clinicaltrials.gov/search?cond={CONDITION}&phase={PHASE_NUM}

Important URL formatting:
- Use urllib.parse.quote for URL encoding sponsor names and conditions
- For trial_url: use format https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/{NCT_ID}
- For search URLs: use https://clinicaltrials.gov/search?... format
- For phases in URLs: convert "PHASE3" to "3", "PHASE2" to "2", etc.
- Handle multiple phases like "PHASE2, PHASE3" properly

Include report metadata:
- report_generated_at: current timestamp
- search_query: the original user query

Calculate percentages, averages, and aggregate data properly.
Ensure all URLs are properly formatted and encoded.
